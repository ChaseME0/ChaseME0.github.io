I'm from Waterford Vermont, which is about an hour east of burlington. I went to the St. Johnsbury Academy for highschool.
My hobbies include playing music on piano and trombone, sking, mountain biking, and of course coding. 
I have one older sister who is also in college right now studying english at Castleton University.
